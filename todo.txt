    Create a landing page (About page) that will load if there is no store logged in

SERVER: 

    Item:   
        # Category
            Allow to display Category sorted column in table

        Items dates are saved as an array for possible future implementation
        The code can read though the array and nest the items in the table
        If this gets to be implemented a PUT call and some more logic on the 
        DELETE call will be required

        # Email or security question
