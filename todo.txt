GENERAL:



SEVER: 

    Item:
        # Date
            Should be Date or String and has 
            to be controlled in input
        # Store Id
            String to have different stores
        # Category
            Should have a category to sort on

    Item date should be an array containing all dates
        and it should handle crud operations.
        # We could fetch the Item and then handle the 
            CRUD operation on client side, replacing
            the item in the server
        # On deletion if the item has no date it should be
            removed from the db

    Store:
        # Name
        # Password
        # Id
        It would be nice to have a simple login
        and fetch items only if a user is logged in

CLIENT:

    # Need a CRUD page for User/StoreId

    # Color on table:
        Yellow if expiry date is in the next 3 days
	    Orange if they are expiring in the same day
	    Red if they are past expiry date

    # Delete button only if the item is expiring in 
        3 days

    # NoMatch and ItemDetails pages are not needed
        as the app can run single page
        # ItemDetails could be used to change date
            and show all available dates of the item

    # ItemsName should be given 

    # Store name on top of the page
