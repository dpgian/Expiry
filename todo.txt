GENERAL:

    Create a landing page (About page) that will load if there is no store logged in
    When logged in the about page will show in the navbar

    Restore password, lost password

    Custom color for items expiring in less than 3 days

SERVER: 

    Item:   
        # Category
            Allow to display Category sorted column in table

        Items dates are saved as an array for possible future implementation
        The code can read though the array and nest the items in the table
        If this gets to be implemented a PUT call and some more logic on the 
        DELETE call will be required

    Store:
        # Email or security question 
            Lost password reset
        
CLIENT:

    # Table messages need to be changed
    
    # Make deletion possible only for items expiring in few days
        It does not have to be implemented, but has to be available

    # Error handling and UX
